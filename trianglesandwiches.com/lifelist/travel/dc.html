		<h2>Visit Washington DC</h2>

On a recent trip to America, I managed to fit in a swing-by of Washington DC. I know, I know - the seat of the power of the United States - a swing by? I needed more time, but I couldn't bear to be so close and just miss out. As time was pressing, I decided to check out some of the major places - The White House, Capitol Hill, the Lincoln memorial - and leave all the rest for a proper visit sometime in the future.

				</p>

Little did I know how hard this plan of action would be to undertake. I am an avid avid West Wing fan and as soon as we entered the city, my brain somehow switched to "gawking fan" mode. I'm not embarrassed to admit I went slightly crazy and possibly demanded that we delay the rest of our trip so that we could stay and check out the town of 'Lemon-Lyman' (inside West Wing reference!) properly! My trip-mate, luckly, kept his cool, but I was really bummed out that I couldn't experience more of the awesome town that is Washington DC. But you know, it is huu-uuge. And it is absolutely chock-full of things to do and see. I would need about a month to really even begin to comprehend the D.C. behemoth.

<a title="Capitol Hill by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/3481513788/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/3481513788_a7e1702730.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill" width="500" height="393" /></a>

I am definitely going to be making a return visit to get to do all of the stuff that I didn't get to do the first time round. And also, just to experience some of the atmosphere. I didn't get to go hang out in some cool place with harried White House staffers and lobbyists rushing in and out. I didn't see swathes of important people looking like the world depends on them getting to their next meeting quickly (though it probably does). I didn't really get to see the machine working. And I'd love to do all of that next time.

As an aside, I wanted to share with you what my most favourite sight in Washington DC was. And it wasn't anything majestic, no kind of memorial, nothing like that. It actually happened upon me when I used a public restroom in the middle of Washington DC. And here it is:

<a title="Wisdom on Back of a Toilet by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/3478167524/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3659/3478167524_cf5f5ccb33.jpg" alt="Wisdom on Back of a Toilet" width="500" height="375" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>	
I couldn't quite capture the entire debate that was being carried out on the back of the toilet door. But let me tell you it ran the full length. It was amazing to me that a debate was being carried out in a public toilet. The only thing scrawled on English toilets that I have ever seen is swear words and phone numbers. And yeah, this may be an abnormal toilet, but on my trip, it seemed to me that even the public toilet graffitos were politically engaged. And that was impressive.
