		<h2>Island Hop in Greece</h2>
			<p class="lifelistbox">
				<p>
					Summer 2008. 4 great friends. A flight to Athens. 3 weeks later, a flight back to London from Rome. One fantastic holiday :)
				</p>
				<p>
					<img class="alignnone" title="Greece 1" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3492/3463346269_bf65ea8208.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" />
				</p>
				<p>
					We flew into Athens, excited at the prospect of what we were doing. We had 3 weeks to get from Athens to Rome, with only our first nights' accommodation booked, and no plans in between. Obviously, we wanted to try and get to a few islands before we had to take the ferry to Italy, but we also wanted to pick right. There are many many Greek Islands dotted round the Aegean, all with very different characters and vibes.
				</p>				
				<p>
					<img class="alignnone" title="Greece 2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/3570386543_589a767d56.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336" />
				</p>
				<p>	
					Our trip ended up taking us to Crete, The Peloponnese and Kefalonia. Each was a completely different experience, and allowed us to have the chance to experience the party side, the historical side, and the relaxing, isolated aspect of Greek Islands.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
				We visited a lot of different places on our trip, the names of which escape me now! The most memorable includes Olympia, the site of the Greek Olympics and which includes amazingly restored buildings and artefacts which really highlight the ingenuity and creative spirit of the Greek people. One highlight was this incredible track for the 100m.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
				Another favourite aspect of travelling around the Greek Islands is the fact that everywhere you go, the smells, sights and sounds of the ocean are around you. One of the great things about this is the amazing seafood. The fantastic array of fresh fish was incredible. Yum Yum YUM.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
				Overall, the best thing about island hopping in Greece was the sense of adventure that permeates the Islands. Every day can lead to a swashbuckling adventure on the seas, steaming ahead to visit the unknown delights of a neighbouring island. And if you're lucky, some great sunsets along the way.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img class="alignnone" title="Greece 6" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3541/3464160764_7f629e797f.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="500" />
				</p>
				<p>
				Greece is one hell of an adventure. Once you go once, you'll want to go back time and time again until you've exhausted the supply of breathtaking islands on offer. We only travelled to a small percentage of the country, but it was one of the best holidays ever.
