				Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do...

					I was never really the camping kind of person. I'm not a princess, but I like to have a nice shower and a comfy bed! So I never really gave camping much thought as a viable travelling option - hostels were enough for me!
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, I had a crazy harebrained idea to go <a href="http://trianglesandwiches.com/lifelist/travel/driveacrosseurope.html">driving across Europe</a>! My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/colinmyer">Colin</a> came with - and Colin is like the camping MASTER. So thats how we ended up in a variety of fields across Northern Europe in the freezing cold in a lovely tent!

				</p>
				<p>	
					Being a complete camping virgin, Colin gave me a masterclass in pitching and dismantling tents. I was put in charge of making sure that the pegs were put into the ground well - a simple task that completely baffled me due to Colin's insistence that the pegs went into the ground at a very specific angle. Angles? Maths? Trigonometry? ARGH!!
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, with a lot of help from Colin, the tent was pitched and un-pitched without any problems. I actually got very good at it by the end. We camped next to some amazing places, the most notable was our night spent camped next to Lake Maggiore.

				</p>
				<p>
					So, my camping virginity has now been broken! And guess what, I kind of want to go again - this time preferably somewhere hot hot hot! Sponsor me?!
