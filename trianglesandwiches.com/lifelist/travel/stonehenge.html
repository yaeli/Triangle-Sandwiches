					Having lived in England for (nearly) all my life, my foreign friends are always astounded to learn that at the age of 24, I've never visited what is considered one of England's premier tourist sites, Stonehenge. On this basis, I decided to put <strong>Visit Stonehenge</strong> on my lifelist!
				</p>
				<p>
					<a title="Partying inside the stones" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4724075868/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1010/4724075868_2e6c218a80.jpg" alt="DSC_0500 (1)" width="500" height="334" /></a>
				</p>				
				<p>
					I was very lucky to be able to achieve this goal to coincide with the Summer Solstice! According to Wikipedia,
<blockquote>The <strong>Summer Solstice</strong> occurs exactly when the Earth's <a title="Axial tilt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt">axial tilt</a> is most inclined towards the sun at its maximum of 23¡ 26'. Though the Summer Solstice is an instant in time, the term is also colloquially used like <em><a title="Midsummer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer">Midsummer</a></em> to refer to the day on which it occurs. Except in the polar regions (where daylight is continuous for many months during the spring and summer), the day on which the Summer Solstice occurs is the day of the year with the longest period of daylight. Thus the seasonal significance of the Summer Solstice is in the reversal of the gradual shortening of nights and lengthening of days. The summer solstice occurs in June in the Northern Hemisphere, in December in the Southern Hemisphere.</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>	
					<a title="The token druid" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4724076068/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1145/4724076068_c35a955236.jpg" alt="DSC_0532 (1)" width="500" height="334" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Worldwide, interpretation of the event has varied from culture to culture, but most cultures have held a recognition of sign of the fertility, involving holidays, festivals, gatherings, rituals or other celebrations around that time. In England, the premier place to celebrate the Summer Solstice is at the ancient site of Stonehenge. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<a title="Blowing Bubbles" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4724079750/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1342/4724079750_230f0fb707.jpg" alt="DSC_0628 (1)" width="500" height="334" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				Again, referring to Wikipedia; <blockquote><strong>Stonehenge</strong> is a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire, about 3.2Êkilometres (2.0Êmi) west of Amesbury and 13Êkilometres (8.1Êmi) north of Salisbury. One of the most famous sites in the world, Stonehenge is composed of earthworks surrounding a circular setting of large <a title="Standing  stones" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_stones">standing stones</a>. It is at the centre of the most dense complex of <a title="Neolithic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic</a> and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds.</blockquote>
On the eve of Summer Solstice, people from all over the world descend upon Stonehenge for an all-night party in anticipation of sunrise! What better time to try and fulfil a lifelist item right?
				</p>
				<p>
				<a title="Waiting for Sunrise" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4724076836/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1023/4724076836_15a5577b18.jpg" alt="DSC_0541 (1)" width="500" height="326" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					So the night before solstice, we packed up our blankets, food and drink, musical instruments and facepaints, and headed on down to Stonehenge. We had no real idea what to expect - we had heard that it was just basically a massive party, where all sorts of people just gathered to have an epic all night party! We were totally up for that, but I was also pretty interested to check out some real, hardcore pagan-type people - the ones that actually went to celebrate as a religious ritual.
				</p>
				<p>
				<a title="Us with our facepaint!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4724079248/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1046/4724079248_5c44c80720.jpg" alt="DSC_0612 (1)" width="500" height="328" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				There were loads and loads of people there (later confirmed to be around 20,000 people), all ready to party and have fun. There was an awesome vibe as we all waited for the sun to come up - everyone was happy and partying, and very very friendly. There were people eating and drinking, people playing instruments, people sitting and dancing as far as the eye could see, chatting and laughing and waiting for sunrise.
				</p>
				<p>
				<a title=" More waiting" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4724077896/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1224/4724077896_1011b843cc.jpg" alt="DSC_0582 (1)" width="500" height="334" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				I wasn't sure how close we would be able to get to the stones, but we managed to get inside the circle and soak up the atmosphere with all the hardcore people and druids! We later settled a bit further out from the stones to get a good view of the main event! 
				</p>
				<p>
				<a title="Welcoming the sun" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4723426725/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1325/4723426725_f9de5ac894.jpg" alt="DSC_0621 (1)" width="339" height="500" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally, sunrise came (inevitably) and the vista was absolutely beautiful. Without sounding like the whole thing has turned me into a massive hippy, it was actually pretty great to just watch the simple but awesome event of the sun coming up that we miss every day. Once the sun started rising, everybody starting cheering, we partied a little more, and then made our way home - exhausted but exhilarated!
