		<h2>Photograph Couples under the Eiffel Tower</h2>
			<p class="lifelistbox">
				<p>
					So, I kinda had a really romantic notion of the Eiffel Tower, it being all iconic and statuesque and lit up and awesome. I assumed that on going to the Eiffel Tower, I would be confronted with lots of frolicking happy couples being all photogenic and shit, and all I would have to do is snap snap snap away with my camera to come home with some excellent shots of cute couples being in love to warm my heart.
				</p>
				<p>				
					I should've known that this was a ridiculous vision, that obviously the Eiffel Tower was going to resemble a heinous tourist trap filled with loud Americans, lots of queues and insane prices, and attracting about as much romance and frolicking couples as the London Dungeon! Yes, I should've known it all, and yes, I was pretty disappointed with the real Eiffel Tower, but hey - I went all the way AAAAND I took some pictures so I'm gonna count this item as crossed off!
				</p>
				<p>				
					Below are a small selection of pics from in, around, and on top of the Eiffel Tower. I would also like to take this opportunity to inform everybody that they took Rob and I FOUR HOURS total to take!! The amount of insane, long queueing at that place is not cool, and I am going to write France a strongly worded letter of complaint about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is how Rob feels on the matter;

					Anyway, you MUST make sure you stare at these photos like crazy and enjoy the hell out of them because the effort that went into procuring them was immense. Thanks! :)
