					I was lucky enough to be able to take a short roadtrip across a tiny part of the Eastern coast of the US, travelling from New Jersey all the way to Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Martha's Vineyard was our end destination, because it is <strong>awesomely</strong> pretty. Plus, Jaws was filmed there - RAD!!

				</p>
				<p>	
					To take this trip, we had to travel through a few states (much to my delight!) - the ride took a good few hours, much of which was spent munching on pretzels and listening to classic american rock stations. Here is a little map that I prepared earlier showing our route:
				</p>

					<a title="Road Trip Route by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4825422280/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4825422280_f16d7235cf.jpg" alt="Road Trip Route" width="452" height="406" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can see, we started in New Jersey, meandered our way through New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and ended up in our destination of choice - Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts! I took the road trip with a couple of great friends, who, luckily enough, have a friend who actually lives on Martha's Vineyard - the lovely Christine.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a title="Boat by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/3477317981/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/3477317981_064fb84115.jpg" alt="Boat" width="500" height="375" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					So, Martha's Vineyard is the weirdest little place I have ever been to. It is full of little houses, gorgeous scenic vistas at every turn, stunning beaches and water everywhere. It is so small that there is a real community feel about - Christine leaves her car in the street, unlocked, with the keys in the ignition without a moment's thought. I guess being a small island, there aren't that many places that thieves would be able to take her car without someone figuring it out. Coming from the insane paranoia and 'Stranger Danger-ness' of London, this mindset was completely and utterly mindboggling!
				</p>
				<p>
					<a title="Landing by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/3477314743/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3379/3477314743_cd2b5ae270.jpg" alt="Landing" width="500" height="376" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					We spent a couple of days mooching around the island - visiting almost every section of it, with Christine making sure we steered clear of the traditional tourist hotspots and instead taking care to take us to the secret local spots instead. We spent a fantastic night on a hidden beach eating good food and drinking good beer in complete isolation. Bliss. Martha's Vineyard was the perfect place to end my mini American roadtrip adventure. Whilst this time, the roadtrip was more about the end destination than the journey, hopefully it'll prove to be the first of many epic epic trips across the United States!
