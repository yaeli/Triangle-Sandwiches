		<h2>Get a Master's Degree</h2>

					This is a picture that I took of my wordcount stats when I <em>finally</em> finished my Masters dissertation! (the best I could really do pictorially when trying to express the finality of the arduous journey towards achieving an MSc without publishing my graduation photo to the internetz!)
				</p>
				<p>
					Getting my MSc is one of the things on my lifelist that I am most proud of, mostly because of the many educational hoops I had to jump through to get there. GCSEs, A-Levels, BSc, thats a lot of memorising and essay-writing! I know that nowadays it is practically a given that to really differentiate yourself from the hordes of people breaking down the doors of our educational establishments, you must complete a Masters. And because of this shift in attitude that getting a Masters is just another educational gold star, I don't think people really allow themselves to bask in the glory and pride that should come from achieving a Masters. It is a real achievement, and I for one have no problem basking away; I could not be prouder of myself!!
				</p>
				<p>				
I was never really one of these people who absolutely <em>knew</em> what I wanted to do and how I needed to get there. To tell you the truth, I kind of fell into doing my Masters with a combination of blind luck and a sense that "everything will turn out all right in the end". I picked Psychology A-Level because I had a vague sense that I would enjoy it, I picked a BSc Psychology because Psychology then became my favourite subject at school, and then I picked a Masters in Organisational Psychology because my OrgPsych module was the actual highlight of my university week.
				</p>
				<p>				
Doing the Masters was everything that I thought it would be and more. Challenging, inspiring, frustrating and a lot of hard work. It feels so strange that it was this time last year that I was embarking on a course into the unknown - I had no idea whether I was up to the educational challenge, whether I would enjoy it, and if it would actually lead anywhere productive. But throughout the course of the year, surrounded by brilliant (and sometimes scary!) people, I realised that I <em>could</em> do this, I was up to the challenge, and that I could hold my own. I finally felt something that I didn't really experience the first time round at university, I felt myself learning, growing, improving and loving the subject. The sense of achievement at the end of the long slog through the year to the end has been incredible, and overwhelming, and I can't really do more to express my happiness at managing to navigate myself through it!
				</p>
				<p>
Most of all though, I'm so glad that the slightly random sequence of events occurred and conspired to lead me to choosing MSc Organisational Psychology, because at the end of the day, it led me to finally figuring out that there is an occupation in this universe that can absolutely fit me - and igniting the spark that drives me forward now.
