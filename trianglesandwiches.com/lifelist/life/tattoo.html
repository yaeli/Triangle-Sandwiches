				I don't know anybody that isn't fascinated with the concept of tattoos. What would you have? Where would you have it? And, OMG but could you live with it FOREVER?!
				</p>
				<p>
				For a long time, I had been mulling over the idea of a tattoo in my mind. I really love the idea of being able to decorate your body with something personal and meaningful, as well as something beautiful.So when it came time to compose my lifelist, having "Get A Tattoo' on it was a complete no-brainer.
				</p>
				<p>
				With a slight feeling of trepidation and a massive feeling of excitement, I went to the very awesome <a href="http://skunxtattoo.com/">Skunx Tattoo parlour</a> in Angel. I had designed 3 different options of tattoos that I would like to get, and had spent a considerable amount of time whittling down the options. 
				</p>
				<p>				
				In the end, I decided to go with a rendering of my favourite song lyric from one of favourite artists, Idan Raichel. This seemed like a safe bet because I had loved the song for ever and it was also personally meaningful, reminding me of a very special time of my life. I had already written out the Hebrew lyric, and when I got to the shop, they just basically made my drawing into a kind of transfer and stuck it to my skin! I decided to get the tattoo across the top of my back and with that, the lovely <a href="http://skunxtattoo.com/tattoos/logan/">Logan</a> started the tattoo process!!
				</p>
				<p>
				So, was it painful? I have to say mostly not. In my opinion, the only reason that the tattoo caused me pain was because of the relentless process. My tattoo took about 45 minutes to complete, and with the attempt to keep dead still plus the needles hammering away at your body with very little respite, it did get a little uncomfortable. But it was honestly not as bad as I had expected - the pain is not enough that you audibly go 'ow' or that you flinch. Its just a bit uncomfortable. I guess it also depends on where you get it. I think the back is a pretty safe bet in terms of pain. So maybe I was lucky!
				</p>	
				<p>
				Anyway, its been about 12 hours since I got it done, and I am now familiarising myself with the vagaries of the tattoo aftercare process! It looks really good right now, but apparently I may have a little scabbing and itching to look forward to in the coming few days which I am not looking forward to! But I am incredibly pleased with how it turned out, especially since it is a literal transfer of what I designed - its a nice feeling to have my own writing on me!! Most of all, I am really pleased that I actually went and got it done! I absolutely love it and can't wait to show it off!!
