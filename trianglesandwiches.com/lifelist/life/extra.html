		<h2>Be an extra in a TV show/movie</h2>
			<p class="lifelistbox">
				<p>
				Okay so I cheated a little with this goal. This little sucker has been crossed off my list for yeeears thanks to living in one of the prime filming locations in London!
				</p>
				<p>
To date, my credits include being an extra in Eastenders (they were filming in the park right next to my house), Holby City (they were filming opposite my friend's house!) and even a whole segment on Songs of Praise (yep, you read that right) with my family!
				</p>
				<p>
But the best experience I ever had being on TV, and the one I would like to share with you today, is being on the News! I was around 8,and my family and I were on holiday in Bournemouth. The holiday was going as holidays went in those days - an endless haze of eating icecream, building sand-structures (mine were never fully formed enough to be graced with the title 'Castle'), and arguing with my little brother about who got to do what first. They were good times!
				</p>
				<p>
Anyway, it just so happened that on one of these lazy, hazy days, there was a freak snowfall! To this day I don't remember how we got a toboggan, just that somehow this amazing red thing was thrust into my greedy little hands to have fun with. After that, all I remember is a massive white hill, covered in thick snow, and my brother and I bundled up in this awfully loud winter accessories my mum seemed to love to buy - bright neon green gloves matched with a shocking pink hat, topped off with a bright yellow scarf with too many tassles. I remember doing a lot of trudging through the snow, climbing this big hill over and over after multiple successful toboggan runs. But most of all I remember flying through the hair, holding onto my brother tightly, as the toboggan flew past all the other children playing on the snowy hill, and feeling exhilarated as I had never felt before.
				</p>
				<p>
It wasn't long before the news cameramen and anchors turned up to use this snowy hill as the backdrop to their reports on the freak weather. I don't remember much of them being there, although they must have been, filming and observing the frivolity in the snow, and perhaps wishing they could come and join in! They asked my parents permission to film my brother and I tobogganing, and I remember feeling that soon to be familiar mix of self-consciousness and need to shine.
				</p>
				<p>
Later that day, after we had come back in from the snow, had our hot showers and been towelled up by my Mum into our comfy pajamas, the TV was switched on in time for the local news. Our news segment soon came on, being one of the bigger stories of the day. You know when a news anchor is reading a story, in the top left corner of the screen there is generally a little box with a picture and perhaps a headline encapsulating what the story being read is about? Well, a still picture of my brother and I racing down the hill on our trusty red toboggan was being used! I remember feeling proud, and excited, that my face, MY FACE, had been on the television screen for sooooooooo looong! You can imagine that my excitement exploded when the moving images flickered up of us and our toboggan, having the time of our little lives.
				</p>
				<p>	
We got the video of the segment, and now sometimes I rewatch those few minutes to bring back the same feeling of exhilaration and excitement that I felt on that day. Snow and Local Celebrity, what more could an 8 year old want in Bournemouth, eh?
