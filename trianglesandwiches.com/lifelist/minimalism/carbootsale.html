		<h2>Sell Unwanted Things at a Car Boot Sale</h2>
			<p class="lifelistbox">

					Don't let anybody tell you otherwise, doing a car boot sale is hard work. Not only do you have to surface at the crack of dawn.. ON A WEEKEND.. but you also have to be mad-vigilant against all the car boot sale thieves and chancers who seem to regard you as fair game.
				</p>

				<p>	
					Yep, thats me being mad vigilant against a car boot sale chancer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also haven't even touched upon what a nightmare it is driving across a muddy field in the early foggy morning trying to find a pitch whilst simultaneously trying your best not to run anyone over. And oh baby, that is made way more difficult by the fact that there seems to be MAJOR overlap between people who go to buy stuff at car boot sales and the people who cross roads without looking and who generally wander around in a state of blissful unawareness of anything around them.
				</p>
				<p>
					DO I SOUND MENTALLY SCARRED BY THIS EXPERIENCE?! I sure hope so, because it is another world, a completely new eco-system, a bit like Pandora, except with way scarier creatures.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					So I went with a friend of mine, and between us we had boatloads of crap to sell. We had books, DVDs, stuffed animals, clothes, jewellery, toiletries, and loads and loads of those unidentified objects that seem to just collect in your home.
				</p>
				<p><a title="Car Boot Sale by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/5057725152/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5057725152_5fcaa6b9dd.jpg" alt="Car Boot Sale" width="500" height="334" /></a>
				</p>
				<p>We managed to sell quite a lot of stuff, and barring the massive theft of about 5 of my leather handbags (which, by the way, are like bloody gold dust at car boot sales, they go crazy for 'em!), I made quite a tidy profit of £70. Not bad for 8 hours work, battling various thieves and unsavoury characters, talking to many many grandmas about the great provenance of my Claire's Accessories jewellery, fending off unwanted advances from hordes of lecherous men and of course, the £10 entrance fee for the pleasure.
				</p>
				<p>Is it an experience I would repeat? The answer is a deafening No. But it was definitely an interesting morning, and it brought me face to face with probably the only person on earth that wanted to buy my ancient stuffed Teddy Mr Gruff for the princely sum of £1. Bargain.
