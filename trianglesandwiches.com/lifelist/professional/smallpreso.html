				So on my lifelist, I have a series of items that deal with one of my dreaded fears - Public Speaking!
				</p>
				<p>
				Although I'm fine talking in front of a number of people in a personal context, when it comes to speaking about professional matters I get very very scared! Its definitely to do with the fact that I need to way improve my confidence levels around self-belief in my skills as a UX Designer. But right now, all I know is, when it comes to speaking in front of my professional peers, I get incredibly nervous!
				</p>
				<p>
				<a href="http://mindcandy.com">Mind Candy</a> recently hosted an Agile Safari where a number of UX professionals came for a tour around our offices and to hear a bunch of us speak about how we worked in an agile environment. I did a little bit around my first impressions of how Mind Candy’s agile thinking is affecting me as a UX designer and the benefits and challenges that this brings. For a fuller write up, see <a href="http://thefightsequence.com/2011/06/25/agile-safari-at-mind-candy/">my blog post here</a>
				</p>
				<p>				
				I spoke to around 50 people, which by my count is enough to qualify for the crossing of this lifelist item. It was a small start, but I'm really proud that I took that first step! Now I just need to take the feedback from my performance on board and hone my public speaking skills so that I feel confident enough to take on the next lifelist item - speaking in front of even more people!
