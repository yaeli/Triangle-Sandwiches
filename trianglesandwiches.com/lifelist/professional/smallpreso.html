				Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do...

				So on my lifelist, I have a series of items that deal with one of my dreaded fears - Public Speaking!
				</p>
				<p>
				Although I'm fine talking in front of a number of people in a personal context, when it comes to speaking about professional matters I get very very scared! Its definitely to do with the fact that I need to way improve my confidence levels around self-belief in my skills as a UX Designer. But right now, all I know is, when it comes to speaking in front of my professional peers, I get incredibly nervous!
				</p>
				<p>
				<a href="http://mindcandy.com">Mind Candy</a> recently hosted an Agile Safari where a number of UX professionals came for a tour around our offices and to hear a bunch of us speak about how we worked in an agile environment. I did a little bit around my first impressions of how Mind Candy’s agile thinking is affecting me as a UX designer and the benefits and challenges that this brings. For a fuller write up, see <a href="http://thefightsequence.com/2011/06/25/agile-safari-at-mind-candy/">my blog post here</a>
				</p>
				<p>				
				I spoke to around 50 people, which by my count is enough to qualify for the crossing of this lifelist item. It was a small start, but I'm really proud that I took that first step! Now I just need to take the feedback from my performance on board and hone my public speaking skills so that I feel confident enough to take on the next lifelist item - speaking in front of even more people!
