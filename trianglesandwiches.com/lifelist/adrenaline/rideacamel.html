					In 2005 I visited Jordan! What an awesome trip, what a weird place. Maybe more about my experiences there some other time. Today, I want to talk CAMELS. Horrible, smelly, spitting, funny-looking, INCREDIBLE camels!						</p>

					All I can really say is Dude! Take a camel ride in some blistering hot place. You'll have a blast! If the weird, disjointed feeling of all the different camel parts moving underneath you doesn't do it for you, then getting up close and personal with these exotic creatures sure will. I was looking through my Jordan photo archives for some photo evidence of this to show you guys, but I only have pictures of 'the view from the camel', or 'other people on camels'. I guess it would have been a pretty mean feat to balance on a moving camel, strike a fierce pose, and do a self portrait!

					So moral of the story: lose the Mercedes, get yoself moving desert-style, at least once!! It was AWESOME!
