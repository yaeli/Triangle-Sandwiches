		<h2>Digitise my collection of favourite quotations that I have collected over the years</h2>
			<p class="lifelistbox">
					So for as long as I can remember, I have been scribbling down phrases, lyrics and quotations that I have heard and thought were AWESOME!
				<p>
					This has ended up with me owning books, lots of post-it notes, and crinkled pieces of paper with these amazing quotes on them. This is A LOT of bits of paper.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided that it would be awesome if I could get all of these down in one place, preferably online, (to help with my minimalist proclivities!)
				</p>
				<p>
					So I did what any regular 20th Century kid would do, and set up a blog!
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://wordsireallylike.tumblr.com" target="_blank"> <strong>Words I Really Like</strong></a>
				</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					I've got a crapload of quotes to get up on there, so this is definitely an ongoing project. But I would love this to become my place on the web where I not only store my inspirational words, but also pictures, videos, links etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check it out! And please feel free to comment over there with your favourite and inspirational quotations too :)
