				Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do...

		<h2>Digitise my collection of favourite quotations that I have collected over the years</h2>
			<p class="lifelistbox">
				<p>
					So for as long as I can remember, I have been scribbling down phrases, lyrics and quotations that I have heard and thought were AWESOME!
				</p>	
				<p>
					This has ended up with me owning books, lots of post-it notes, and crinkled pieces of paper with these amazing quotes on them. This is A LOT of bits of paper.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided that it would be awesome if I could get all of these down in one place, preferably online, (to help with my minimalist proclivities!)
				</p>
				<p>
					So I did what any regular 20th Century kid would do, and set up a blog!
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://wordsireallylike.tumblr.com" target="_blank"> <strong>Words I Really Like</strong></a>
				</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					I've got a crapload of quotes to get up on there, so this is definitely an ongoing project. But I would love this to become my place on the web where I not only store my inspirational words, but also pictures, videos, links etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check it out! And please feel free to comment over there with your favourite and inspirational quotations too :)
