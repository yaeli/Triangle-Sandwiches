		<h2>Send a handwritten letter to a friend</h2>

				<a title="Letter to Jen by The Fight Sequence, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosdiscontinued/4818677656/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4818677656_76b32ac252.jpg" alt="Letter to Jen" width="500" height="334" /></a>
				<p>
					I included this item because I <em>never</em> send handwritten letters. To get into contact with my friends, I can call, text, email, IM, facebook or tweet them - each of these takes little effort, a bit of typing, and is instantaneously sent. Why on earth would I expend all the effort it takes to write a legible, elegant handwritten letter, buy a postage stamp, go to the letterbox and wait for it to be delivered?						</p>
				<p>
					But there is a good reason isn't there? Receiving a handwritten letter from a friend today means that they have expended all that effort <strong>on YOU!</strong> It means they care about you. It means they wanted to create something special for you, something tangible. They wanted you to experience that thrilling moment when you find out that you have a letter - and it's not a bill!!
				</p>
				<p>	
					So I included this item of my list because I have a number of friends that I would love to give that experience to. I decided to pick my best friend Jenni, who is soon going away for a long holiday to India. I picked out some special linen ivory embossed paper, used my good pen, even composed a rough draft first so that there would be no mistakes on the final version. Doing all of this, plus writing it out nicely, it probably took me the best part of an hour.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					It was completely worth it, because she'll know that I took this time - and however nice the written sentiment is, knowing that somebody has made the effort is worth ten times more. So, write someone special a letter today.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					I can't wait to give it to her :)
