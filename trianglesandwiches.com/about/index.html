				Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do...

		<h2>About Yael's lifelist</h2>	
		<div class= "intro">
			<p>
				Inspired by Maggie Mason's blog <a href="http://mightygirl.net/">Mighty Girl</a>, I began to think about my lifelist at the end of 2009, when I wrote a big list of things that I wanted to accomplish in my life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Initially writing this list was one of the scarier things that I have ever done - I didn't realise until that point that I could actually give myself permission to want to do these seemingly impossible or impractical things. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have been following this list from that day on, and since its inception, my life has changed in ways I could never have predicted. The lifelist is a constantly evolving beast, as it grows with  me and my goals. The aim is to keep crossing off items and keep living my dreams.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Triangle Sandwiches is a way for me to be able to document my stories and adventures - each time I cross off a lifelist item, I'll write a post about my experiences here. Publishing my lifelist on the internet means that my dreams and goals are out there in the world - I can document when I achieve a goal, rather than let them go wordlessly past, something that is vitally important. We don't recognise our achievements enough. The list varies from the simple everyday tasks to the expensive and crazy once-in-a-lifetime opportunities - each of these is worth celebrating. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope you enjoy following me on my journey to actually getting some of these babies accomplished!
